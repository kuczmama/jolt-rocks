# JOLT FAQ

# What is Jolt?

Jolt combines an alarm clock with new EDM music. We were sick of hearing the same ringtone every morning and figured a music player combined with an alarm clock would do the trick.

# Where can I download?!

Check out our [homepage](http://www.jolt.rocks) and select iOS or Android!

# How does it work?

Simply set the alarm time, hit the check box, and wake up to a new song at the desired time!

# How are songs selected?

We acquire music from several sources. We primarily contact artists on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/joltalarm) and Soundcloud. We then invite the artists to submit their music on our website submission form (http://submit.jolt.rocks). Anyone can submit music, however the curators at Jolt will hand select music. We make sure it&#39;s Jolt-worthy.

# The song is &quot;featured&quot;- What does that mean?

The way Jolt is currently designed to play a song for ONE 24 hour period. After this period is complete, the next song will be featured. Each song is only featured temporarily- Jolt doesn&#39;t own the music. This prevents both parties be respectful of ownership issues.

# What else are you adding?

We can take Jolt several directions, however we like the current trajectory. We don&#39;t want to be an app that features music, promotes concert tickets, and sells you a loyalty programs for fast food breakfast. It&#39;s about the music and improving your morning. We can envision expanding genres, increasing featured music, and even developing Bluetooth devices. Have suggestions? Email ithink@jolt.rocks
