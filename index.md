	<h1>About Jolt</h1>
	<hr />
	<h2>What is Jolt?</h2>

	<p>Jolt combines an alarm clock with new EDM music. We were sick of hearing the same ringtone every morning and figured a music player combined with an alarm clock would do the trick.</p>

	<h2>Where can I download?!</h2>

	<p>Check out our <a href="http://www.jolt.rocks">homepage</a> and select iOS or Android!</p>

	<h2>How does it work?</h2>

	<p>Simply set the alarm time, hit the check box, and wake up to a new song at the desired time!</p>

	<h2>How are songs selected?</h2>

	<p>We acquire music from several sources. We primarily contact artists on <a href="https://www.facebook.com/joltalarm">Facebook</a> and Soundcloud. We then invite the artists to submit their music on our website submission form (http://submit.jolt.rocks). Anyone can submit music, however the curators at Jolt will hand select music. We make sure it's Jolt-worthy.</p>

	<h2>The song is &quot;featured&quot;- What does that mean?</h2>

	<p>The way Jolt is currently designed to play a song for ONE 24 hour period. After this period is complete, the next song will be featured. Each song is only featured temporarily- Jolt doesn&#39;t own the music. This prevents both parties be respectful of ownership issues.</p>

	<h2>What else are you adding?</h2>

	<p>We can take Jolt several directions, however we like the current trajectory. We don&#39;t want to be an app that features music, promotes concert tickets, and sells you a loyalty programs for fast food breakfast. It&#39;s about the music and improving your morning. We can envision expanding genres, increasing featured music, and even developing Bluetooth devices. Have suggestions? Email ithink@jolt.rocks</p>
